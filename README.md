# punit-shah.github.io

Personal website

## Getting started

These instructions are for myself if I ever forget what to do.

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Clone the repository and run `yarn install`.

Build the site

```sh
yarn build
```

Listen for changes to source files and automatically build changes

```sh
yarn watch
```

Start the development server and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

```sh
yarn start &
yarn open:local
```

Deploy the site to Github Pages and open http://punit-shah.github.io/ in your browser

```sh
yarn deploy
yarn open:live
```
